          "A cappuccino is a classic coffee drink that originates from Italy. It's typically made with equal parts of espresso, steamed milk, and milk foam. The espresso provides a strong, rich coffee flavor, while the steamed milk adds a creamy texture, and the milk foam gives it a light, frothy top. Cappuccinos are often enjoyed in the morning or as a pick-me-up during the day, and they're known for their balanced and delicious taste!",
